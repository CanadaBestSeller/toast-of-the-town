            <h4>Testimonials:</h4>
                <p class="quote" style="text-align:justify">“Within 6 months of joining TOT Toastmasters, I was looking for a new job. The wonderfully supportive meeting environment and the opportunity to practice speaking and leadership skills have had a tremendously positive impact on my life, especially at this challenging career time. I accepted an opportunity to be one of 7 speakers before 75 potential employers. I practiced my “elevator speech,” which was a succinct introduction of me and my skills. I built in the gestures and pauses at key points of my presentation for emphasis – and as a safety net to help me maintain my focus should nerves set-in. The day of the event, I arrived early to become familiar with the speaking area.<br><br>Panic set in when the first speaker was handed a hand-held microphone; the house lights dimmed and a lone light shone on them. How was I to gesture with a mic in my hand? After my speaking turn went well, I remember smiling at the audience. That likely turned to a beaming smile during the Question/Answer period after everybody spoke.<br><br>One employer stood up and asked that I speak with him later that day. While my next job was not with this company, I am positive that this speaking opportunity and the practice at Toast of the Town Toastmasters led to my success in my current employment. I am very appreciative of the increase in confidence that is evident in all aspects of my personal and professional life. The combination of speaking and leadership skills practiced through Toastmasters really builds confidence.”</p>
                <p class="QuoteAuthor">- Lynn C. (member since January/2013)</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="quote" style="text-align:justify">“I joined ToT in the Fall of 2012 as a way of learning a new skill and doing it together with my husband. We both felt it would be useful to become better public speakers. We really enjoyed the first meeting at Toast of the Town and immediately decided to join. The supportive and encouraging environment at the meetings kept us coming back and really helped us improve. I was nervous with both prepared and impromptu speaking at first but got really comfortable speaking in front of people within a few months and really enjoy it today. This is not to say that I don't have butterflies before speaking publicly, I still do, but once I start speaking, it goes away.<br><br>This comfort made a huge difference last year (2013). I had founded a nonprofit earlier in the year and entered a competition called Social Venture Fast Pitch. Thanks to the skills I'd gained at Toastmasters as well as a LOT of practice, I won a few awards that included $20,000 in grant money. This gave my organization a lot of momentum and visibility. We talk about our Toastmasters experience a lot with our friends and encourage everyone to give it a try.”</p>
                <p class="QuoteAuthor">- Veena P. (member since 2012)</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="quote" style="text-align:justify">“This might sound a little strange, but I was at a friend’s funeral and they asked if anyone wanted to come up to the front of the church and say a little about the guy who had died. No one moved, but I had been in Toastmasters long enough to get over the jitters, and I thought that it was important for someone to say something, so I walked up there and gave a little speech with a good opening, middle and close. As I was walking up to the front I thought of a strong close, so I turned to my friend’s widow and said "and thank you, Patty, for taking good care of my friend." I heard sobs throughout the church, so I knew I had done a good job. Everyone complimented me afterwards.”</p>
                <p class="QuoteAuthor">- Ed L. (member since 1998)</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="quote" style="text-align:justify">"I started my Toastmasters adventure in California in the fall of 2012 and was very pleased to find Toast of the Town in my new neighborhood when I moved to Seattle a year later. TOT is a very friendly and dynamic club that offers lots of opportunities to grow as a speaker, team player, and leader—every single week. Not only did TOT allow me to speak regularly enough to finish my Competent Communication manual (Toastmasters' first series of prepared speeches) and start Advanced manuals within the first six months, but club members also encouraged me to use my leadership skills and become a club officer. I have gained a lot of confidence in my ability to speak in public (with preparation or on the spot), provide feedback, organize and facilitate meetings, and contribute to my club's success."</p>
